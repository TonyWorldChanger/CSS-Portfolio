# CSS-Portfolio

## Description
Created a starter portfolio page to introduce myself as well as showcase progress throughout the journey of becoming a web developer. 

## Installation
No installation required

## Usage

[Github Page Address](https://tonyworldchanger.github.io/CSS-Portfolio/)

 There are 4 main navigation buttons at the top of the screen
 - About Me
 - The Journey (shows what I've been learning)
 - Contact Me
 - Resume
 
        - All will work (except resume for now, due to not having a resume for we) to navigate you to the main parts of the page.
- The Journey section has a hover feature that will eventually be used to take the user to another page with examples and projects completed.
